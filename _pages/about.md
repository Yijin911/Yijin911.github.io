I am a Ph.D. candidate under the Statistics track of the [Industrial and Systems Engineering school](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Institute of Technology, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaoming Huo](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/xiaoming-huo).

Prior to Georgia Tech, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Statistics in 2020 from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC), advised by [Prof. Canhong Wen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9oZ58-0AAAAJ&hl=en).

I am broadly in the utilization of statistical tools in the exploration of methodologies. Specifically, my research topics include: concentration inequality, kernel methods, dimension reduction, variable selection, fairness representation learning, and preference learning for LLM fine-tuning.
